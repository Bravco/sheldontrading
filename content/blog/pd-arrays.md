## Premium & Discount

Commonly refered to as **Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)**, **Equilibrium** or **Premium & Discount**.

As traders, we aim to buy at a discount and sell (short) at a premium.

The **Equilibrium**, marked at the **0.5** level of a price range, can also serve as a confluence for potential trade entries.

To mark out **Premium & Discount**, we first identify the **Swing High** and **Swing Low** that define the most recent price range.

## Fair Value Gap (FVG)

A **Fair Value Gap (FVG)** is a three-candle pattern where the middle candle’s body creates a gap that the wicks of the other candles do not fill.

They represent areas of market **Imbalance** and **Inefficiency**, where price hasn’t filled all resting orders.

Usually, price tends to return to this areas to fill the orders before continuing in its original direction.

## Inverse Fair Value Gap (IFVG)

An **Inverse Fair Value Gap (IFVG)** occurs when price closes beyond a previous **Fair Value Gap**, invalidating it.

Afterward, it often acts as a support or resistance level in the opposite direction.

## Balanced Price Range (BPR)

A **Balanced Price Range (BPR)** combines a **Fair Value Gap** and an **Inverse Fair Value Gap**.

It’s the overlapping zone where an **Inverse Fair Value Gap** formed, followed by a **Fair Value Gap** in the opposite direction.
